    about: [
      "During my 7-month co-op at MORSE Corp, I worked on a complex React/Redux website, developing new features, providing bug fixes, increasing text coverage, and refactoring outdated code. I worked with the Esri ArcGIS map engine, as well as the Electron offline version of the application. I also used Sketch and InVision to design the UI for new product features and review them with the customer.",
      " My typical work involved assessing an issue, creating mockup designs in Sketch, iterating and improving them, and then fully implementing those designs in the product's code. I had the opportunity to take features all the way from inception to implementation.",
      " Due to the confidentiality of the product, I have not included any images or descriptions of the projects I worked on at MORSE.",
